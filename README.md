# Terminal Text Editor

## Overview

Terminal Text Editor is a learning-focused project aimed at understanding how core text editor features work at a low level. The application is built in Java and leverages **JNA (Java Native Access)** to call native operating system C APIs, enabling direct manipulation of terminal behavior such as input handling and screen rendering.

This project is designed for experimentation, exploration, and deeper insight into how terminal-based editors function under the hood.
